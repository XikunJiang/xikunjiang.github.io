Hi! I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/) in the [Software, Data, People & Society (SDPS) Section](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/sdps/). I finished my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2023 at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/index.aspx), working with [Yuan Luo](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=155) and [Fan Wu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/).

Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of **economics**, **data science**, and **machine learning**. My research focuses on designing algorithms for new ways to trade and use data. Iâ€™m also excited about **verifiable machine learning** and **trustworthy AI**.

Outside of research, I love building fun side projects. You can check out my camera app [AngleMe â€“ Perfect Portrait Guide](https://angle-me.github.io/) or my foodie helper app [DineMate](https://dinemate.net/).
